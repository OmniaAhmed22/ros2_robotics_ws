Project#1 Diff_robot_project_keyboard_move_and_publish_pose

In this project, a differential-drive robot is controlled via the keyboard.
The keyboard provides the robotâ€™s center velocity, and the kinematic model computes and publishes the corresponding wheel joint speeds.
The movement is simulated in Gazebo and RViz2, with launch files created for both the controller and the keyboard.
